Trim Galore version: 0.6.6
Cutadapt version: 1.18
Python version: could not detect
Number of cores used for trimming: 8
Quality Phred score cutoff: 30
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count Illumina: 0, count Nextera: 0, count smallRNA: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; default (inconclusive auto-detection))
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 50 bp
Removing Ns from the start and end of reads
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed

WARNING:
    The adapter is preceded by "C" extremely often.
    The provided adapter sequence could be incomplete at its 3' end.
